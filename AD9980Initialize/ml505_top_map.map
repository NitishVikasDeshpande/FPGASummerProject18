Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    57 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          160
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            56 out of     160   35%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   2 out of     160    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         102 out of     160   63%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               8 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
